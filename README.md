# k-weighted traveling repairman problem (kWTRP)

The kWTRP is a generalization of the traveling repairman problem where k repairmen must service a set of n clients. A positive weight and repair time are associated with each client. The weight of a client corresponds to their waiting per time unit. The repair time provides the required time to accomplish the maintenance action. The objective of the kWTRP is to minimize the weighted sum of the clients latencies.
